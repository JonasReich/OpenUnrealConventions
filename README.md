# Open Unreal Coding Conventions

These coding conventions should serve as a foundation for all aspects of Unreal Engine programming. This means they cover not only C++ code, but also Blueprints and Python.

## WIP Status

The coding conventions are a work-in-progress project. This list shows the current status of the sub-conventions:
| domain | progress |
|-|-|
| C++ | 90% |
| Blueprint | 0% |
| Python | 0% |
